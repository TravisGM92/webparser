  #   summary = 'Creatine monohydrate is an organic compound that helps facilitate recycling of ATP in muscle and brain tissue and is found in vertebrates. It was first discovered in 1832 by Michel Eug√©ne Chevreul, and the first evidence of its benefits on the muscles was found in 1912 by Harvard University researchers. Creatine became available as a dietary supplement in 1993, and since then it has become one of the most widely studied supplements. Creatine is commonly taken by athletes and bodybuilders and has become a staple of workout supplements.'
